# Payroll Application

## Prerequisites

1. **Visual Studio**:
   - Install **Visual Studio 2022** or later with the following workloads:
     - .NET Desktop Development
     - ASP.NET and Web Development

2. **NuGet Packages**:
   - Ensure the following NuGet packages are installed in the solution:
     - `RestSharp`
     - `Newtonsoft.Json`

3. **Acumatica ERP Instance**:
   - You will need access to an Acumatica ERP instance.
   - If you do not already have an instance, set up a new Acumatica instance for testing.

## Configuration Steps

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

### 2. Open in Visual Studio
- Open the `.sln` file in Visual Studio.

### 3. Configure the `RestClient`
- Locate the configuration file (`App.config`, `appsettings.json`, or inline code) and update the `baseUrl` to match your Acumatica instance:
  ```json
  {
    "baseUrl": "https://<your-instance-url>/entity/<erp-name>/<version>"
  }
  ```

### 4. Update Login Credentials
- Replace the placeholders with the correct credentials for your Acumatica instance:
  ```csharp
  var request = new RestRequest("auth/login", Method.POST);
  request.AddJsonBody(new
  {
      name = "<username>",
      password = "<password>"
  });
  ```

### 5. Configure Ports (if necessary)
- If the application uses a specific port, ensure the port is updated to one that is available on your machine. This can typically be done in `launchSettings.json` or IIS Express settings.

### 6. Set the Startup Project
- Ensure the executable project (e.g., `PayrollApp`) is set as the **Startup Project** in Visual Studio.

## Running the Application

1. Build the solution to restore all dependencies:
   - In Visual Studio, click **Build > Build Solution**.

2. Run the application:
   - Press `F5` or click **Start** to launch the application.

---

## Notes

- **REST API**: The application communicates with Acumatica via REST API. Ensure that:
  - The API endpoint is enabled.
  - The instance URL, username, and password are correctly configured.

- **Environment-Specific Configuration**:
  - Ports, base URLs, and credentials will differ based on the setup environment. Please review and update these settings before running.

---

## Common Issues

### 1. **401 Unauthorized**
- Ensure the credentials (username and password) are correct.
- Verify that the user account has the necessary API permissions in Acumatica.

### 2. **Endpoint Not Found**
- Confirm that the REST API is enabled in your Acumatica instance.
- Check that the `baseUrl` is correctly configured.

### 3. **Port Conflicts**
- If the port is already in use, update the port configuration in `launchSettings.json` or IIS Express settings.

## Debugging Tips

1. Use Visual Studio's debugger to step through the code and identify issues.
2. Check the Acumatica instance logs for API request errors.
